# To-Do List

Simple app that stores user-submitted data permanently in the form of a to-do list.

## Getting Started

This is one of the first projects that I built while learning Swift in my spare time during coding bootcamp. While the layout, code, and usability is fairly simple, this was my initial introduction to more advanced iOS features that can be used in my future apps.

### iOS Features Used

* Table Views
* Permanent Data Storage
* Using Multiple View Controllers
